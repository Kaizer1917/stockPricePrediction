# Trend Prediction and High-frequency Trading Strategy Using Limit Order Book

This project explores the application of advanced data processes/machine learning to predict near-term price movements and generate trading signals using Level2 (Limit Order Books) data from financial markets. 

Some of the procedures include time series analysis using ARIMA, SARIMAX and LSTM models for a single tradable asset, regression of price predictions, and classification of buy, sell, and hold signals. A simulated trading environment was used to evaluate the profitability of these models. 

The results from this empirical investigation highlight the challenges and opportunities of leveraging high-frequency trading data in developing automated trading strategies that capitalize on second price movements. The findings emphasize the importance of sophisticated data-processing and feature-engineering techniques to improve the accuracy and profitability of predictive trading models.
